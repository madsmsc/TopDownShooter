    TODO:

    bulletPool doesn't work... check it out. just make it instantiate all objects to debug

    go through all scripts and make as much private as possible.

    make the debug window have boolean in the editor that hides/shows
       info and make the window scale accordingly.

    why doesn't my fps counter match the editor stats fps counter?

    talents:
        salvage: get armor and power from dead enemies
        plating: more armor
        tomb raider: 10% chance of more currency
